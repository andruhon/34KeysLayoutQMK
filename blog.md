# Changelog

I was irritated by standard keyboards and mouses decades and tried many different things including MS Ergonomic keyboard and trackballs finding little satisfaction. Adesso WKB-3150UB keyboard with trackball was somewhat close, but still not good enough.

Moved keycaps into a separate repo https://github.com/andruhon/deafpotatokeycaps

I got sick of VIAL and converted layout to plain QMK.

## 29 Jul 2024
I was tinkering with Keychron layout for some time and ended up with 37 keys layout, inspired by Matt Gemmell's Corne layout a lot.

The Shift as a 37 key sits on the layout because it was not possible to set up auto-shift in VIA without re-flashing the keyboard. This was all looking good so I ordered 42 keys Corne from https://github.com/klouderone


## 29 May 2024
Somewhere in early 2024 I decided that I need split keyboard like Corne, but cost of building one was rather repelling, so I decidet to first go with somewhat more or less industrially produced, so on 27 of May I have ordered  Keychron V8 QMK with brown switches. Keyboard arrived 3 days later and I started tinkering with VIA config in attempt to prove that 42 or 36 keys layout is usable.
