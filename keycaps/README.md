# Generating keycaps

Keycaps are at early prototyping stage. I will later organise and document everything properly.

*  [keycap-edit-gui.scad](keycap-edit-gui.scad) A slightly modified generator from  karlh5926@gmail.com (aileron.me). It generates keycaps with flat tops.
*  [newcaps.scad](newcaps.scad) A new generator which uses pre-generated stls for caps and can use SVGs for letters and symbols.
*  [newcaps-poly.scad](newcaps-poly.scad) A generator of compound caps to be assembled with [newcaps-poly-stems.scad](newcaps-poly-stems.scad). Assembling it from two parts hopefully allows these caps not to require colouring.
